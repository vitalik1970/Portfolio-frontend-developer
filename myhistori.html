            <div class="text-black histori">
                <p class="item">I want to tell a short story of traveling in the IT industry. And it’s unusual, because
                    I started doing it at the age of 51, usually people in such cases already have success in career
                    growth, have housing, cars ...</p><br>
                <p class="item">Until 2014, I lived in the Luhansk region of Ukraine, I also had a house, a car, and the
                    job of a director of an educational institution. But after the start of the war in the East of the
                    country, he literally lost everything, having left his place of residence with one suitcase.</p><br>
                <p class="item">With the start of a full-scale war in 2022, I again had to leave my apartment, car, job
                    and leave the Donetsk region. In the city of Kyiv, my son rented an apartment for me and pays all my
                    expenses, since I have no work.
                    It is difficult to find a job in the country now, and there are problems with health. My son, who is
                    engaged in programming, suggested that I try myself in this area. I understood that for a number of
                    reasons at this age they no longer begin to do this
                    , but I had no other option, and I started learning HTML with video tutorials, then CSS, JS ... In
                    addition to the desire to earn a living on my own, I have a great desire to prove that it is never
                    too late to start something new.</p><br>
                <p class="item">And here I am, a "young" website developer, I want to offer people who need to do layout
                    work and everything related to the frontend developer will contact me, and I, due to the fact that I
                    need to gain practical experience
                    is ready to perform the work for a fee that you see fit to assign after the delivery of the work to
                    you.</p><br>
                <p class="item">I think this is a mutually beneficial cooperation. You get the work done for little
                    money, thereby supporting the person mastering
                    a difficult profession at the age of 52, starting a life from scratch for the third time because of
                    the war. I get, first of all, practical experience, and, well, a livelihood. I will consider any
                    suggestions.</p><br>
                <p class="item">P.S. There is a movie whose motto is "it's never too late to start anew" in which a
                    63-year-old woman becomes the coach of a youth football team. <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz4zBRqhTiI&t=1315s">(movie link here)</a> And every time
                    when people found out about it, they said: "Are you serious?!". In the end, she succeeded, the main
                    thing is to believe and not give up in the face of the difficulties that arise!</p>
                <p class="item">P.S.2. I want to express my gratitude to my son for the great moral and material
                    assistance he provides. </a> </p>
